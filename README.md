BookReview is a website which acts as a guide to exceptional books, providing you with all you need to know about the books that matter. Among much else, BookReview provides in-depth reviews, buying options, ranks of the books, information about the authors and many more review article links of various books. Pranith is the main programmer of the webpage and has worked on the Html and java script. Sujitha has worked on the Data model and CSS scripts. Shreya is the one who came up with the initial idea and has contributed towards CSS and Java Scripts.
